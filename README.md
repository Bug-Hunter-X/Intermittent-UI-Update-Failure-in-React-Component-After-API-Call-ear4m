# Intermittent UI Update Failure in React Component After API Call

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React component intermittently fails to update its UI after a successful API call. The component fetches data, but the changes are not reflected in the UI. The issue is difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

A React component fetches data from an API.  Under normal circumstances, the component should update its UI to display the fetched data. However, intermittently, the UI does not reflect the changes, even though the API call is successful and the data is available.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the component's behavior. The bug might not manifest immediately, requiring multiple refreshes or interactions with the application.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by ensuring React re-renders correctly after the data fetch is complete. This is done by making sure that the data changes are handled properly within the component's state and re-rendering logic.
